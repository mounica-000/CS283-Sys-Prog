## Warmup Assignment

#### Questions to Answer
Please provide answers to these questions using markdown notation and place them in the `\0-Warmup` directory in your git repository:

1. Select with an `x` the platform you will be using for your course deliverables:

    - [ ] drexel's tux cluster
    - [`x`] WSL on Windows
    - [ ] Orbstack on MacOs
    - [ ] VMWare Fusion
    - [ ] Somthing else (put name here)

2. I have installed my virtual machine, tested it, feel comfortable using it, and validated that the required software is installed:

    - [`x`] YES
    - [ ] N/A - I plan to use tux
    - [ ] NO - Not Yet


3. Please provide a link to the repository you are using for this class.

    - https://github.com/mounica-000/CS283-Sys-Prog

4. Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class.

    - I want to understand how to build and run programs on Linux, I never really understood how to make make-files and automate the build process. I also want to know how system calls, processes and threads work, how a computer understands and performs all these things, even if not at a super deep level.
    
5. Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any).

    - Only concern is taking 18 credits this term, with a few coding classes, so might be having too much work on my plate throughout the whole term but hoping to manage my time well so that I don't fall behind.
